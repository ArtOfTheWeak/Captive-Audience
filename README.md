# Captive-Audience

Captive Audience is an interventionist piece that occurs within a public Wi-Fi space. When a device connects to it, it is redirected to a captive portal page. A captive portal is a web landing page often used to authenticate and monitor wireless access on public Wi-Fi networks such as those available in airports, hotels, restaurants and on public transport. Typically landing pages serve as gateways to online connectivity, however, the landing page in Captive Audience does not connect to the Internet. It is used as a platform to transmit text-based communications directly to the device (and users) that connect to the SSID.

The project is based on code from the yourSunny blog, available [here.](https://yoursunny.com/t/2017/freewifi/)
